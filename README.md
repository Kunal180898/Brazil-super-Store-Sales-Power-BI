Key Insights:
Furniture and Electronics categories generate the most sales, with sub-products like Health & Beauty and Watches performing exceptionally well.
Agriculture and Baby Products have high average dimensions, increasing freight costs.
Heavier products see fewer orders, with significant drops at 40kg, indicating weight-sensitive buying patterns.
